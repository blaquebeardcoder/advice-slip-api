# advice-slip-api
A practice API call project for TKH
The second assignment for class is to create a one page web application using the Advice Slip API. 
It has to be done on your personal Github, and a link to your Github repo will be needed for submission. 
Only basic CSS is needed. 
Here is the website https://api.adviceslip.com/
You are expected to actually take the time to read the documentation ( Itâ€™s a short documentation, not a lot).

Your web application has to generate random advice at the click of a button. 

You must accomplish this with what we learned in class using axios. 

Use the other tasks we did in class , and hopefully if you did the movie assignment first. Use those resources to assist you with this. 

Bonus:
A search box a.k.a an input field that generates advice from keywords the user puts in. Thus generating a second API call. 

For reference: you can look at my own project:
